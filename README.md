# React Form Mastery

A comprehensive guide to building complex forms with React Hook Form and Zod schema validation. This project demonstrates various form patterns and validation techniques with a clean, professional UI built using Chakra UI.

## Features

- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **React Hook Form** for efficient form state management
- **Zod** for powerful schema validation
- **Chakra UI** for beautiful and accessible UI components
- **Syntax highlighting** for code examples

## Demo Forms (Completed)

1. **Basic Registration Form** - Learn fundamental form validation including required fields, email format, and password matching.

2. **Multi-step Form** - Create wizard-style forms with state persistence between steps using Zustand.

3. **Dependent Fields Form** - Build forms with conditional fields that appear or change based on values entered in other fields.
