# React Form Mastery

A comprehensive guide to building complex forms with React Hook Form and Zod schema validation. This project demonstrates various form patterns and validation techniques with a clean, professional UI built using Chakra UI.

## Features

- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **React Hook Form** for efficient form state management
- **Zod** for powerful schema validation
- **Chakra UI** for beautiful and accessible UI components

## Complete Form Examples

1. **Basic Registration Form** - Learn fundamental form validation including required fields, email format, and password matching.

2. **Multi-step Form** - Create wizard-style forms with state persistence between steps using Zustand.

3. **Dependent Fields Form** - Build forms with conditional fields that appear or change based on values entered in other fields.

4. **Array Fields Form** - Handle dynamic arrays of fields with add/remove functionality - perfect for managing lists of items.

5. **File Upload Form** - Implement file uploads with comprehensive validation for file type, size, and count limitations.

6. **Nested Objects Form** - Structure complex forms with deeply nested objects while maintaining clean validation and error handling.

7. **Async Validation Form** - Implement server-side validation checks such as username availability.

8. **Custom Validation Form** - Create sophisticated custom validation logic beyond what schema validation provides out of the box.

9. **Dynamic Fields Form** - Generate form fields dynamically based on external data or API responses.

10. **Internationalized Forms** - Build forms with multi-language support for labels, placeholders, and error messages.
